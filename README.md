hi randoms keep taking my skins 1:1, so im going to say rn if they look like me and they dont have a github attached to their pony that specifically says "mycrvsh" THAT IS NOT ME!! I AM NOT THAT PERSON, OK!!! however if you happened to run into these people (you can js check if they have no github but its pretty obvious if u took a quick look at them as they happen to look more chopped than my normal ponies since they cant seem to get it 100% accurate despite color picking everything) it would be nice if you told me,, just send me a msg on my discord or send an image link to me through sp.. ok? my discord is kazvha... you dont have to talk to them on my behalf, i just dont want people mistaking them as me. tthanks,!! ^_^

also if the people who has taken my skins are reading this, i know i probably wont be able to get you to stop, but please also send me a msg on discord, and i can tell you how to make skins instead or at least give you a few tips.. you dont have to take my skins.. ok? please be kind, ok..

im going to put some additional info here for pt only since i dont have any room for it in my links... and also because you decided to read all that stuff above, which i appreciate,, thank you again 

i like sitting with people, but i never usually approach people for cuddles because im terrified of inting first.. if you were nice to me one time i might approach you first, though ill most likely keep to myself. im sorry if i seem scary, i swear im kind,, if anything, im probably more scared of you than you are of me.. please sit with me; i like it when people do..

i dont talk a lot. i likely wont talk unless you speak to me first. im kind of just terrified of initiating anything with anyone until i think we're close enough.. i wont be that way with you forever; once we talk more ill start opening up... please be patient with me

if you want to friend me, please dont panic if i dont show up on your friend list. im usually on offline mode, but i think its pretty easy to find me anyway since i dont usually move locations a lot, and my gh will always be linked to all my skins.. but if youre having trouble finding me or youre unsure if im online, send me a msg and ask ^^ ill respond quickly if i am

i dont hide people permanently (without reason). if i disappear out of nowhere while youre talking to me and it seems like ive hidden you, its probably because you were trying to roleplay with me, or you made me uncomfortable (which, as long as youre normal towards me, you dont have to worry about). my hides usually only last for 15 minutes or 24 hours, and you wont be hidden again if you dont do whatever you did the first time again

ship ints are ok; im fine with a majority of ships as long as theyre normal... iwec/dni if you want to do ship ints for dblfed though,, sorryyy...

i dissociate a lot.. thats not really important because i wont tell you if i am, but if you ever wonder why i disappear for long periods of time, that may be the reason why. dont worry if i dont show up for a while, i should come back eventually

about the disappearing thing.. if you miss me, please message me. im being serious when i say i dont mind if you do, and ill be glad to talk to you any time. im not mean, and i wont pelt you with rocks simply for missing me.. ok?

llaalala i thinks that all for now.. ok thanks for reading!! joy joy joyous
